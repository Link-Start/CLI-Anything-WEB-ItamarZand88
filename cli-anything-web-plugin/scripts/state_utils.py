"""Shared JSON-state I/O helpers for phase-state.py and capture-checkpoint.py.

Both scripts manage a JSON state file in an app directory and need the same
primitives: load-or-default, save-with-timestamp, UTC now. Extracted here so
there is one implementation — a bugfix (e.g., atomic write, file locking)
lands in one place.

Note: Deliberately does NOT unify the two scripts' schemas or CLIs. Skills
invoke them by subcommand, and changing either public surface would break
downstream callers.
