# cli-web-tripadvisor

Search TripAdvisor for locations, hotels, restaurants, and attractions (read-only, no auth, DataDome bypass built in).
Install: `pip install -e tripadvisor/agent-harness`

## Commands

| Command | Purpose | Key options |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `locations search QUERY` | Resolve destinations to `geo_id` | `--max N` (default 6) |
| `hotels search LOCATION` | Hotels in a destination | `--geo-id ID`, `--page N` |
| `hotels get URL` | Full hotel detail by TripAdvisor URL | |
| `restaurants search LOCATION` | Restaurants in a destination | `--geo-id ID`, `--page N` |
| `restaurants get URL` | Full restaurant detail by URL | |
| `attractions search LOCATION` | Things to do in a destination | `--geo-id ID`, `--page N` |
| `attractions get URL` | Full attraction detail by URL | |

Search commands take a destination name ("Paris") and resolve it to a `geo_id` automatically; pass `--geo-id` to skip that lookup (faster). Results are 30 per page. `get` commands take the `url` field from search results.

## Examples

```bash
# Hotels in a city (returns name, rating, review_count, price_range, address, url per hotel)
cli-web-tripadvisor hotels search "Paris" --json

# Skip location lookup with a known geo_id, paginate
cli-web-tripadvisor restaurants search "Tokyo" --geo-id 298184 --page 2 --json

# Resolve a destination to geo_id first
cli-web-tripadvisor locations search "New York" --max 10 --json

# Things to do
cli-web-tripadvisor attractions search "London" --json

# Detail lookup from a search-result URL
cli-web-tripadvisor hotels get "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187147-d229968-Reviews-..." --json
```

## JSON output

Every command accepts `--json`. Success responses are keyed by resource, e.g. `{"success": true, "location": "Paris", "geo_id": 187147, "count": 30, "hotels": [...]}` (or `"hotel"`, `"restaurants"`, `"attractions"` accordingly). Errors return `{"error": true, "code": "...", "message": "..."}`.

## Utilities

`cli-web-tripadvisor doctor [--json]` self-diagnoses the local setup (install, auth, dependencies). `cli-web-tripadvisor mcp-serve` serves the commands as MCP tools over stdio.

## Agent tips

- Workflow: `hotels search` → take `url` from a result → `hotels get URL` for full detail.
- Search and view only — booking is not implemented.
- Running with no subcommand opens an interactive REPL.
