No authentication required.

# cli-web-producthunt

Browse Product Hunt launches, leaderboards, and users (read-only, no auth, Cloudflare bypass built in).
Install: `pip install -e producthunt/agent-harness`

## Commands

| Command | Purpose | Key options |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `posts list` | Today's launches from the homepage | |
| `posts leaderboard` | Daily/weekly/monthly leaderboard | `--period daily\|weekly\|monthly`, `--date YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `posts get SLUG` | Product detail by slug | |
| `users get USERNAME` | User profile | |

## Examples

```bash
# Today's top products (returns name, tagline, slug, votes_count, comments_count, rank)
cli-web-producthunt posts list --json

# Last week's leaderboard
cli-web-producthunt posts leaderboard --period weekly --json

# Leaderboard for a specific date
cli-web-producthunt posts leaderboard --date 2026-03-15 --json

# Product detail (slug comes from list/leaderboard results)
cli-web-producthunt posts get stitch-2-0-by-google-2 --json

# User profile (name, headline, followers_count)
cli-web-producthunt users get rrhoover --json
```

## JSON output

Every command accepts `--json`. Success returns the data directly (a list of posts, or a post/user object); errors return `{"error": true, "code": "...", "message": "..."}`.

## Utilities

`cli-web-producthunt doctor [--json]` self-diagnoses the local setup (install, auth, dependencies). `cli-web-producthunt mcp-serve` serves the commands as MCP tools over stdio.

## Agent tips

- Prefer `posts list` / `posts leaderboard` data over `posts get`: the detail page's HTML differs, so its `votes_count`/`comments_count` can be 0 and `name` may include the tagline.
- `description` is only populated by `posts get`; `rank` is null in leaderboard output (use array order).
- Running with no subcommand opens an interactive REPL.
